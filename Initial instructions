How do we set up the project?
1. We clone or download the project repository from github into cloud9 IDE.
2. Once done, we run bundle install on to check with all dependencies.
3. On successful completion, we type the command "rails server -b $IP -p $PORT" to start our web app server.
This gets our project running on the server.
